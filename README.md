# Efficient Logistic Routing in India
This project aims to find the most efficient route between any two given cities in India, considering all modes of transport - air, water, road, and railways. The approach taken is holistic, considering cost-effectiveness and environmental impact.

# Getting Started
To get started with this project, you can clone the repository and open the Efficient Logistic Routing.ipynb file in a Jupyter Notebook environment.

# Project Structure
The project includes the following files:
Efficient Logistic Routing.ipynb: This file demonstrates the algorithm and methodology used to determine the most efficient route.

# Algorithm and Methodology
The algorithm used in this project considers the following factors to determine the most efficient route:
Distance
Cost
Environmental impact

# The project takes a holistic approach, considering the best combination of modes of transport to determine the most efficient route.
Example
For example, the project may determine that the most efficient route from Delhi to Hyderabad is Delhi to Mumbai (air), then Lucknow to Hyderabad (road), which is the most cost-effective and environment-friendly approach.
